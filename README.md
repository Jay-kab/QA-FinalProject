# QA-FinalProject


Software Development Bootcamp Final project
This is my submission for completion of Software Development Bootcamp. 
•	Why are we doing this?
The project task is to create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies using a managed database hosted locally( MySQL) and a means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence

•	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
I used Java as the core technology to maintain the front view part I am used JSP, HTML, CSS. To handle the server request I used servlet and to store data or maintain the back-end records using the MYSQL database. I used HTML to create front-end GUI functionality like input fields, Heading of all pages, page title, Buttons ETC. Html provides Tags for every part of page design. For example, I am creating a footer of the page. So there is a footer page is available similarly header tag for the header part and the body tag for the body part of the page.
I used Servlet as a server-side programming language. Which is responsible to handle the request which is coming from the view part. As we are using MVC architecture so the controller part would be handled by the only servlet by the post and Get methods.
I used the Tomcat server which provides by the apache corporation and its open-source server. Which is helps to deploy and run our application on the localhost server? It will generate a local URL with the localhost and port number(XXXX) with the project name. It will help to compile and run our JSP and servlet code as well. In this project, we are using MySQL to store the data of employees. So we are using MVC with every java project to manage the View part, Controller part as well as model part.
•	What didn’t go as planned
I was unable to make my delete method functional.
•	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
To continue learning and practising
•	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
